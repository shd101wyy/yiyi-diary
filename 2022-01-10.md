Hi Bogdan,

Yes the vacation was great! We went to visit my wife's parents and had a wonderful new year there. We also settled down few things for the wedding. However, my wife bought a pair of shoes of the French brand "Roger Vivier" for the wedding from someone she met online since we are not physically in France. The shoes got delivered from Pairs to Beijing just few days ago but turned out to be fake. That guy also sent use a fake receipt trying to deceive us. Fortunately we called the real sales of the store in Pairs and the sales confirmed that everything we got was fake. Now we are trying to get our money back from that bad guy.

As for the payment to my work for startupiq, I am not sure how much it should be to be honest, but arount \$800 - \$1000 will be far more than enough. If possible I would like to get paid by crypto like USDC or USDT to my wallet address `0x0357a932E648E72136893C3C8984FBcA1A5cEA3f` . If crypto is not possible then I also accept paypal or chase quickpay to my email address `shd101wyy@gmail.com`.
