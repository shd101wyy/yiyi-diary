Hey guys. I watched the interview to Dong Yoo.

He seems to have been working on blockchain area for 3 years.  
Used web3 APIs in his projects, mostly on front-end development part.   
Used python for data science and web development. Experience with django and flask.  
Used angular, react.js, and vue.  
Used MetaMask in his project in blockchain company.  
Worked with one smart contract developer, one UI designer , and front-end developer on his team.  
He had daily standup on slack with a weekly sprint meeting.  
Okay with being both "prototyping" role and "maintaining" role.  

I also looked at the code he sent us. It contains two projects, `swap` and `stake`. Both projects are web3 dApp. The front-end was written in React.js, which look okay to me.  
Both projects are very standard React.js front-end work.  

I would suggest we wait for more interviews done before we decide if we will continue with Dong Yoo. What do you guys think?  

Thanks!
