We are currently using the Halogen entirely in `runtimeverification/firefly-web`, `runtimeverification/erc20-website`, and partly in `runtimeverification/rvsite`.  

We are now building AMP in `runtimeverification/rvsite` repo. And we already used the Halogen to build the following components for our RV website:
* Employee cards on the team page
* Contact form (on contact page, career page)
* Website header
* Papers on publications page

There are a few reasons why we could consider using the React.js and TypeScript (a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript) instead of Halogen and PureScript in the front-end development of AMP:

---

React.js, developed by Facebook and actively supported by the community of developers, is the most used front-end web framework among software developers wordwide. 

React.js is much more popular than Halogen in the industry. React.js also has better ecosystem than Halogen. There are many open source projects using React.js which offer many resuable front-end components that we could use in our AMP. For example, there are [React Scheduler](https://devexpress.github.io/devextreme-reactive/react/scheduler/) (We could use it for scheduling),  [Github issues viewer](https://github.com/paulnta/github-issues-viewer) ([demo website](https://github-issues-demo.firebaseapp.com/), we could take it as reference to implement our notes system), and many more. In the contrast, it's hard to find such projects in Halogen that offer the similar resuable front-end components that we could use in AMP. We would either have to implement the front-end components (like the scheduler) ourselves in Halogen or use the PureScript FFI to wrap some JavaScript libraries to create the front-end components to use, but both ways will take some time.   

I am personally more efficient in developing front-end in React.js compared to Halogen. However, since RV's main focus is not web development, I might be the only one familiar with React.js in the company, so it might be hard for me to get helps (if needed) from other coworkers on front-end development if we use React.js, and it's also hard for code review. But if in the future we are planning to hire more web developers, it's much easier to hire a React.js developer than Halogen developer in my opinion.

Morever, considering the fact that we will interact with the GitHub API intensively, I would suggest we use the GitHub GraphQL API instead of the GitHub REST API. The GitHub GraphQL API offers more precise and flexible queries than the GitHub REST API. 

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/code/) is officially supported in JavaScript (TypeScript), but not PureScript. Besides, interacting with web APIs is much easier in JavaScript (TypeScript) than PureScript. 

For example, if we are going to query a list of the github issues from the `kframework/k` repo, using the REST API, we will need to query `GET https://api.github.com/repos/kframework/k/issues`, which will return us a JSON:

```json

You could see that the result contains many fields that we probably don't need when rendering the notes on AMP. And we can't specify the fields we want to query using the REST API. 
After we get the `issues`, in order to get the `comments` of the issues, we will have to call the REST API again like `GET https://api.github.com/repos/kframework/k/issues/2402/comments`.  
In the contrast, using GraphQL API we could query the fields that we need precisely.  For example, we could get issues and their comments in **one** GraphQL query:

```graphql
query { 
  repository(owner:"kframework", name:"k") {
    issues(first: 3) { # Get first 3 issues
      nodes {
        createdAt
        author {
          login
        },
        title,
        # body, # body of the issue
        createdAt,
        updatedAt,
        comments(first:10) { # Get 10 comments
          nodes {
            author {
              login
            },
            body,
            createdAt,
            updatedAt
          }
        } 
      }
    }
  }
}
```

and it will return the result that contains the specific fields we want, like:

```json

Since we are going to use the GitHub issues in `runtimeverification/security` private repo (<- Please correct me here if I am wrong) as the back-end to store the notes on AMP, we will only expose the personal access token of `rv-auditor` to our back-end server. The workflow will be like:

Front-end (JavaScript or PureScript) send GraphQL query  ---> Haskell back-end receives the GraphQL query, redirect the query to GitHub API server with the personal access token of `rv-auditor`, return the result back to front-end.
